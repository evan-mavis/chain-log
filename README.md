## Overview

Chain Log focuses on three goals at a time — Daily, Short‑term, and Long‑term — and a lightweight daily log. The calendar shows your streak visually (of daily logs), and a Stats bar summarizes recent progress. Demo mode lets anyone try the experience without creating an account.

### Features

- **Daily log**: quick notes + mood (happy/meh/sad) with one‑click edit
- **Streak calendar**: see your chain; prefetches and caches visible months
- **Goals**: one active goal per type (daily/short/long), complete to archive
- **Completed goals**: filter and browse history
- **Stats bar**: current/best streak, last 7 days, this month, completed goals
- **Quote of the Day**: daily inspirational quote from ZenQuotes API, stored in database; updated via GitHub Actions cron job
- **Email reminders**: scheduled daily reminders based on user's timezone (Resend + cron)
- **Unsubscribe**: one‑click HMAC‑signed link; success page included
- **Demo mode**: no auth, seeded logs/goals/stats; server actions disabled
